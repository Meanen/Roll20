A caster with an axe to grind may have cast polymorph or true polymorph for some petty offense committed by you or a loved one. Maybe you unwittingly donned a cursed magic item.

You were in your alternate form for years. How was living in that form different from the way you lived your life before? In what ways were you more powerful? Less powerful? Do you miss the strength of your old form, or are you glad to be back in your own flesh? If you were a wild animal or a monster, how did you survive in the crowded urban environment of Solace? Were you kept in a menagerie or a circus? Or as an exotic pet? If you were an object, what were you used for and by whom? Was your owner aware of your true nature?"

Most likely, you were a member of an established scavenging crew, in which case you are a tiefling if you\u2019ve been scavenging in the Broken Lands for a period longer than the past two years.  In doing so, you provided a valuable service by providing your fellow citizens with much-needed resources, and did so at considerable danger to your own person. As such, members (whether current or former) of scavenging crews that explored the Broken Lands are looked on with favor and admiration by their fellow citizens. Who were the other people on your crew, and how long did you work together? Are you still close, or did you have a falling out with them? What kind close calls with the Maelstrom or other dangers did you survive together--or did you lose people along the way in your dangerous line of work? Alternately, you may have never left the city at all and simply be a denizen of the lower levels who scrounges discarded tech that has fallen from the upper tiers of the city. What secondhand treasures have you unearthed in Solace\u2019s scrap heaps? Did you have allies or rivals who sought to aid or stymie you in your scavenging forays in the city?"
